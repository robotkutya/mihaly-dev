Hi,

This is my portfolio page that I update before I want a new job. Last time I found one so fast that I didn't even post anything... yet! :P

Let's throw together a quick todo list / ideas for content:
- let's try and update the dependencies, would be kind of funny to see how bad the jokes are about the JS ecosystem
- I need a solution to share code, so a good code block library
- "What nobody talks about AI..." (yes, I know it's grammatically not correct) ~ an articaly about how one can use agentic coding to do TDD
- Deep dives (The state of react state, storybook and design systems and UI testing)
- Building in the open, a few common things e.g. complicated forms and big performant tables
- ... ??? I'm sure I'll think of some more
